* Database schema:

    1. The database is keyed with the name of the bike
        TODO : Cleanup the key name to be useful
    2. Currently the key-val storage looks like:


        Bike-Name :
               |_ _ Url
               |_ _ Price
               |_ _ Location
               |     |_ _ Lat
               |     |_ _ Long
               |_ _ Description

    3. Explore Firebase Cloud Functions to automate DB cleanup
        1. If a listing goes down -> prune the record

* Using the data:

    1. Filter out the bikes i might be interested in
        1. Choose a set of factors (start with these)_
              1. Model 
              2. Price
        2. Have an index associated with the bikes that are found
              - Need to think of weighted index
              - Let's start with just price factor, lowest price wins


* Front-End Stuff:
    1. Have a webpage to go through the datbase to work tbhrough data
        - basic HTML 
            - Start with a button that shows lowest priced bike
            - Next - button to plot the bikes on the map
    2. Javascript to render the maps
        - Goes over the database to plot a map
