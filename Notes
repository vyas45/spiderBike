* Database schema:

    1. The database is keyed with the name of the bike
        TODO : Cleanup the key name to be useful
    2. Currently the key-val storage looks like:


        Bike-Name :
               |_ _ Url
               |_ _ Price
               |_ _ Location
               |     |_ _ Lat
               |     |_ _ Long
               |_ _ Description
